The six cards that a player can see can be swapped and arranged to their desire. Once all of the deck has gone, they have no cards in their hand, and they've gotten rid of the three cards facing upwards, they can reveal one card by random to put onto the in-play deck, if it's not eligible to go on top of the last card because doesn't fit the card rules then the player must pick up the in-play deck.</p><br>
